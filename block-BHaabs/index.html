                        <p class="text">Lorem lpsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem lpsum has been the industry's 
                            standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to 
                            make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                            remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
                            Lorem lpsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including 
                            versions of Lorem lpsum.

                           It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its
                           layout. The point of using Lorem lpsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to 
                           using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop pusblishing packages and web
                           page editors now use Lorem lpsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many 
                           web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
                           purpose (injected humour and the like).
